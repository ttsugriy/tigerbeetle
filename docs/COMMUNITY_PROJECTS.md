## Applications in the Wild

* [Plain Text Accounting with TigerBeetle](https://github.com/pondersource/pta-tb-experiment#pta-tb-experiment)

## Database Clients Made With ‚ù§Ô∏è  By the Community

They are not officially supported by TigerBeetle but we do our best to
support them anyway!

Keep in mind before our first release there will be frequent breaking
changes. We integration-test all first-party clients but third-party
clients may lag behind.

* [tigerbeetlex](https://github.com/rbino/tigerbeetlex): An Elixir client for TigerBeetle
* [tigerbeetle-cpp](https://github.com/kassane/tigerbeetle-cpp): TigerBeetle C++ Client
* [tigerbeetle-rs](https://github.com/ZetaNumbers/tigerbeetle-rs): Safe bindings to TigerBeetle

Need a client for Go, Java, Node.js, or .NET? We've got you covered
with [first-party
clients](https://github.com/tigerbeetledb/tigerbeetle/tree/main/src/clients).
